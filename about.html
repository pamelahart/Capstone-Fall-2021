    <h1> About the Project</h1>
    <p>
        PawPacer is a mobile app focused on the synergy of physical, mental & social health of dogs and their owners.<br>

        The project incorporates UX Design, motion graphics and p5js. A Figma mobile prototype showcases key features of walking, playing and socializing to help owners track their steps and save their routes to share with other dog owners.<br>
    
        Research, surveys and SME's in the fields of veterinary health, dog foster care and design theory helped to identify pain points of dogs and their owners. The science behind the benefits of owning and walking your dog was overwhelming. Using data and research, layouts were developed in Figma for the key features which led to the design and development of a mobile prototype, UX style guide, subscription box campaign, promotional video and a branded, scalable design system.<br>
    
    <h1> Problems</h1>
    
    <p>
        Dog owners, whether new or long timers, have experienced an unprecedented time in history with its share of challenges. Physical fitness is disrupted by new routines. Many are working from home, pandemic prohibiting travel to a gym or flying to an ski resort for vacation. Our friends and families were no longer daily fixtures offering interactions. And our work / life / school balance turned into a river of jello as everything began blending together. Work, study physical fitness all happening in the same place every day. Many owners struggled finding or keeping a routine to balance their well-being. The synergy of physical activities, social interactions and a good mental state suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
        What happens when our wellbeing is not balanced? <br>
        Could this be prevented? <br>
        Can the union of dog and owner be beneficial to both? <br>
    
        Obesity, heart disease, anxiety, stress, isolation, depression are some of the issues that owners suffered from before, during and now as we move forward into a new normal of the Covid pandemic. How we work, play, relax and maintain our wellbeing needed help adjusting and navigate daily routines with our dogs. <br>
        
        Research finds that many wellbeing aliments are shared by dog and owner. It could be one reason, it could be several reasons that work in combination to throw off the balance of their overall health. Dogs and their owners require the same physical, mental and social needs to be met in order to operate with a balanced synergy. When those needs are not met, the wellbeing of both dog and owner suffer. The effects can lead to shorter lives riddled with physical, mental and social issues unless steps are taken to rebalance. <br>
    
    </p>
    
    <h1> Solutions</h1>
    <p>
        Physical exercise has always been a factor to maintain good health. The pandemic and the world reaction to it, proved how vital mental and social health have also become. The millions of deaths, quarantine restrictions, social distancing and poor daily routines dramatically changed how people and dogs live. People need companionship and physical interactions to help keep their mentality balanced, now more than ever. The uptick in the number of dogs that were adopted was the highest it had been in years. The pet industry also saw a steady increase in the amount of money dog owners were spending on their best friends. Dogs are important to their owners and owners are important to
        their dogs. And it turns out, dogs need the same physical, mental and social stimulation as their owners. The common requirements and their strong connection to one another led to the development of addressing their shared needs for
        achieving long happy, healthy lives together.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Process</h1>
    <p>
        To maintain a healthy, balanced lifestyle I created a mobile app to help and inspire owners and dogs to stay fit, feel happier and meet their social needs on a daily basis.
        <br>
        The process began by defining the key features of the app. Walk, play and socialize with the help of an interactive map, alerts and a dashboard to stay organized. Low fidelity prototypes were drawn and tested to determine user journeys and help define my key target audiences into personas of four types of owners. Refinements to designs were made to streamline multiple user journeys into more fluid expected patterns.
        <br>
        As the project moved into an expanded design system, additional elements were added. They included coding patterns in p5js, packaging designed in Illustrator and Photoshop, videos created in After Effects, high fidelity mobile and desktop prototypes generated in Balsalmic, Marvel and Figma. To align the elements, branding guidelines and a UX style guide were created. Solidifying research findings, maximizing SME feedback and additional prototype testing influence design decisions for a final set of deliverables. Next steps would include adding the setup screens with customized dog alerts, finalizing user journeys in the three key features, testing and final refining. Future exploration would include training challenges and GEO caching with an AR scavenger hunt.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Summary</h1>
    
    <p> 
        The science behind the project and research done provided insights which yielded a well developed   design system that is expandable, unique and utilized new skills in a variety of programs. The prototype mobile app is a viable pocket companion to inspire, motivate and track activities to attain your wellness goals with your dog by your side. Pain points were identified and addressed to help owners walk their dog regularly, incorporate playtime and enable social activities that allow for social distancing when needed. The goal to enable dogs and owners to lead long, healthy,
        happy lives was achieved if more owners have been inspired by this project to be a dog walker. By focusing on dog and owner imprinting, natural companionship and empathy, the PawPacer app encourages healthy routines to keep the delicate synergy of physical, mental and social health balanced for dogs and owners. <br>
        <H3>Be a dog walker. Walk, play and socialize yourself to a well balanced lifestyle with your dog.</H3>
