    <h1> About the Project</h1>
     <p>
        PawPacer is a mobile app focused on the synergy of physical, mental & social health of dogs and their owners.<br>
        
        The project incorporates UX Design, motion graphics and p5js. A Figma mobile prototype showcases key features of walking, playing and socializing to help owners track their steps and save their routes to share with other dog owners.<br>

        Research, surveys and SME's in the fields of veternary health, dog foster care and design theory helped to identify pain points of dogs and their owners. The science behind the benefits of owning and walking your dog was overwhelming. Using data and research, layouts were develped in Figma for the key features which led to the design and development of a mobile prototype, UX style guide, subscription box campaign, promotional video and a branded, scalable design system.<br>

        <h1> Inspiration</h1>

        Physical exercise was a huge factor in good health, but the pandemic and the world reaction to it proved now how vital mental health had become. The quarantine restrictions to save lives for months and now over a year and 9 months for some, dramatically changed how society socializes as well. People need companionship and interactions to help keep their mentality balanced. Turns out that dogs need the same physical, mental and social stimulation as their owners. Their connection led to the development of addressing their needs for achieving long happy, healthy lives together.
