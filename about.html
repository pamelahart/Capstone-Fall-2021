    <h1> About the Project</h1>
     <p>
        PawPacer is a mobile app focused on the synergy of physical, mental & social health of dogs and their owners.<br>
        
        The project incorporates UX Design, motion graphics and p5js. A Figma mobile prototype showcases key features of walking, playing and socializing to help owners track their steps and save their routes to share with other dog owners.<br>

        Research, surveys and SME's in the fields of veternary health, dog foster care and design theory helped to identify pain points of dogs and their owners. The science behind the benefits of owning and walking your dog was overwhelming. Using data and research, layouts were develped in Figma for the key features which led to the design and development of a mobile prototype, UX style guide, subscription box campaign, promotional video and a branded, scalable design system.<br>

    <h1> Problems</h1>

    <p>
        How do I help dogs and owners achieve physical, mental and social needs to keep them balanced during a pandemic and
        beyond? <br>
        What happens when they are not balanced? Obesity, heart disease, anxiety, stress, isolation, depression to name a few. These shared by dog & owner.<br>
        Could this be prevented? Why would this happen? Why would any dog or owner let themselves get to such a point of being
        unbalanced, unhealthy and unhappy all at once? <br>
        Quite frankly, its just part of our lives. Sometimes that life wheel hits rough patches, needs more attention or obstacles may be in the way. It could be one reason, it could be several reasons. The fact is, dogs and their owners require the same physical, mental and social needs to be met in order to operate with a balanced synergy of physical, mental and social activity. When those needs are not met, the overall health and wellbeing of both dog and owner suffer and lead to shorter lives riddled with issues with a dominoe affect that results in overall poor health.

    <h1> Solutions</h1>
    <p>
        Physical exercise was an obvious factor in good health, but the pandemic and the world reaction to it, proved how vital
        mental health and socialization had also become. The millions of dealths, quarantine restrictions, social distancing and
        daily routines dramatically changed how people and lived. Society learned that people need companionship and interactions to
        help keep their mentality balanced, now more than ever. The uptick in the number of dogs that were adopted as a resulte was the highest it had been in years. The pet industry also saw a steady increase in the amount of money dog owners were spending on their best friends. Dogs are important to their owners and owners are important to their dogs. And it turns out, dogs need the same physical, mental and social stimulation as their owners. The common connections led to the development of addressing their shared needs for achieving long happy, healthy lives together as a shared symbiotic relationship with mutal good benefits.

    <h1>Process</h1>
    <p>
        To maintain a healthy, balanced lifestyle and ward off the really bad effects from an unbalanced one, I created a mobile app to help and inspire owners and dogs to stay fit, feel happier and meet social needs on a daily basis. The science is there to assure good results and the app is your pocket companion to inspire, motivate and track activities to attain your wellness goals with your best four-legged companion by your side. My focus was to eliminate pain points of walking your dog regularly, incorporate playful activites to do with your dog and enable social activities that allowed for social distancing when needed to enable dogs and owners to lead a long, healthy happy lives. Become a dog owner and walk, play and socialize yourselves to a good balanced lifestyle.
