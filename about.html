    <h1> About the Project</h1>
     <p>
        PawPacer is a mobile app focused on the synergy of physical, mental & social health of dogs and their owners.<br>
        
        The project incorporates UX Design, motion graphics and p5js. A Figma mobile prototype showcases key features of walking, playing and socializing to help owners track their steps and save their routes to share with other dog owners.<br>

        Research, surveys and SME's in the fields of veternary health, dog foster care and design theory helped to identify pain points of dogs and their owners. The science behind the benefits of owning and walking your dog was overwhelming. Using data and research, layouts were develped in Figma for the key features which led to the design and development of a mobile prototype, UX style guide, subscription box campaign, promotional video and a branded, scalable design system.<br>

    <h1> Problems</h1>

    <p> 
        Dog owners, whether new or long timers, have experienced an unprecendented time in history with its share  of challenges. Physical fitness is disrupted by new routines. Many are working from home, pandemic prohibiting travel to a gym or flying to an ski resort for vacation. Our friends and families were no longer daily fixtures
        offering daily interactions. And our work / life / school balance turned into a river of jello time. You worked, studied & got fit in the same place, all the time. To the point that days blended together, time slipped away or wasn't fast enough. Many owners struggled keeping a routine and to balance their well-being. The synergy of owners physical activities, social interactions and good mental state suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
        What happens when our well-beling is not balanced? <br>
        Obesity, heart disease, anxiety, stress, isolation, depression to name a few. <br>
        These aliments are shared by dog and owner.<br>
        Could this be prevented? <br>
        And why would this happen? <br>
        Quite frankly, its just part of our lives. Sometimes that life wheel hits rough patches, needs more attention or obstacles may be in the way. It could be one reason, it could be several reasons. The fact is, dogs and their owners require the same physical, mental and social needs to be met in order to operate with a balanced synergy of physical, mental and social activity. When those needs are not met, the overall health and wellbeing of both dog and owner suffer and lead to shorter lives riddled with issues with a dominoe affect that results in overall poor health.
    </p> 
    
    <h1> Solutions</h1>
    <p>
        Physical exercise was an obvious factor in good health, but the pandemic and the world reaction to it, proved how vital
        mental health and socialization had also become. The millions of dealths, quarantine restrictions, social distancing and
        daily routines dramatically changed how people and lived. Society learned that people need companionship and interactions to
        help keep their mentality balanced, now more than ever. The uptick in the number of dogs that were adopted as a resulte was the highest it had been in years. The pet industry also saw a steady increase in the amount of money dog owners were spending on their best friends. Dogs are important to their owners and owners are important to their dogs. And it turns out, dogs need the same physical, mental and social stimulation as their owners. The common connections led to the development of addressing their shared needs for achieving long happy, healthy lives together as a shared symbiotic relationship with mutal good benefits.

    <h1>Process</h1>
    <p>
        kno
        
        To maintain a healthy, balanced lifestyle and ward off the really bad effects from an unbalanced one, I created a mobile app to help and inspire owners and dogs to stay fit, feel happier and meet social needs on a daily basis. <br>
        The science is there to assure good results and the app is your pocket companion to inspire, motivate and track activities to attain your wellness goals with your dog by your side. My focus was to eliminate pain points of walking your dog regularly, incorporate playful activites to do with your dog and enable social activities that allowed for social distancing when needed to enable dogs and owners to lead a long, healthy happy lives. Become a dog owner and walk, play and socialize yourselves to a good balanced lifestyle.
