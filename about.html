    <h1> About the Project</h1>
     <p>
        PawPacer is a mobile app focused on the synergy of physical, mental & social health of dogs and their owners.<br>
        
        The project incorporates UX Design, motion graphics and p5js. A Figma mobile prototype showcases key features of walking, playing and socializing to help owners track their steps and save their routes to share with other dog owners.<br>

        Research, surveys and SME's in the fields of veternary health, dog foster care and design theory helped to identify pain points of dogs and their owners. The science behind the benefits of owning and walking your dog was overwhelming. Using data and research, layouts were develped in Figma for the key features which led to the design and development of a mobile prototype, UX style guide, subscription box campaign, promotional video and a branded, scalable design system.<br>

    <h1> Problems</h1>

    <p> 
        Dog owners, whether new or long timers, have experienced an unprecendented time in history with its share  of challenges. Physical fitness is disrupted by new routines. Many are working from home, pandemic prohibiting travel to a gym or flying to an ski resort for vacation. Our friends and families were no longer daily fixtures offering interactions. And our work / life / school balance turned into a river of jello as everything began blending together. Work, study physical fitness all happening in the same place every day. Many owners struggled finding or keeping a routine to balance their well-being. The synergy of physical activities, social interactions and a good mental state suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
        What happens when our well-beling is not balanced? <br>
        Could this be prevented? <br>
        And why would this happen? <br>

        Quite frankly, its just part of our lives. Obesity, heart disease, anxiety, stress, isolation, depression to name a few were some of the issues that owners suffered. These aliments are also shared by dog and owner.Sometimes that life wheel hits rough patches, needs more attention or obstacles may be in the way. It could be one reason, it could be several reasons. The fact is, dogs and their owners require the same physical, mental and social needs to be met in order to operate with a balanced synergy. When those needs are not met, the overall health and well-being of both dog and owner suffer leading to shorter lives riddled with issues like obesity, heart disease, anxiety, stress, isolation and depression to name a few. <br>
    
    </p> 
    
    <h1> Solutions</h1>
    <p>
        Physical exercise was an obvious factor in good health, but the pandemic and the world reaction to it, proved how vital mental health and socialization had also become. The millions of dealths, quarantine restrictions, social distancing and poor daily routines dramatically changed how people and dogs lived. People need companionship and physical interactions to help keep their mentality balanced, now more than ever. The uptick in the number of dogs that were adopted was the highest it had been in years. The pet industry also saw a steady increase in the amount of money dog owners were spending on their best friends. Dogs are important to their owners and owners are important to their dogs. And it turns out, dogs need the same physical, mental and social stimulation as their owners. The common requirements and their strong connection to one another led to the development of addressing their shared needs for achieving long happy, healthy lives together. 
    </p>

    <h1>Process</h1>
    <p>
        To maintain a healthy, balanced lifestyle and ward off the really bad effects from an unbalanced one, I created a mobile app to help and inspire owners and dogs to stay fit, feel happier and meet social needs on a daily basis. <br>
        The process began by defining the key features of the app. Low fidelity prototypes were drawn and tested to determine user journeys and help define my key target audiences into personas of four types of owners. 
        Refinements to designs were made to streamline multiple feature user journeys into more fluid patterns.  
        <br>
        As the project moved into an expanded design system, additional elements were added. They included coding patterns in P5JS, packaging designed in Illustrator and Photoshop, videos created in After Effects, high fidelity mobile and desktop prototypes generated in Balsalmic, Marvel and Figma. To align the elements, branding guidelines and a UX style guide were created. Solidifying research findings, maximizing SME feedback and additional prototype testing influence design decisions for a final set of deliverables. 
    </p>

    <h1>Summary</h1>

    <p> The science behind the project and research done provided insights which yielded a well developed design system that is expandable, unique and utilized new skills in a variety of methodologies and new programs. The prototype mobile app is a viable pocket companion to inspire, motivate and track activities to attain your wellness goals with your dog by your side. Pain points were identified and addressed to help owners
    walk their dog regularly, incorporate playful activites to do with your dog and enable social activities that
    allow for socialization and social distancing when needed. The goal to enable dogs and owners to lead long, healthy, happy lives was achieved if more owners have been inspired by this project to be a dog walker. By focusing on dog and owner imprinting, natural companionship, empathy and encouraging routines design patterns, branding and storytelling evolved into a final project. <br>
    <b>Become a dog owner. Walk, play and socialize yourself to a good balanced lifestyle with your dog.</b>
