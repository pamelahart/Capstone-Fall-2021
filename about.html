    <h1> About the Project</h1>
    <p>
        PawPacer is a mobile app to help dogs and their owners balance their physical, mental and social health. The project incorporates UX Design, motion graphics and p5js to develop a brand strategy for a scalable design system. High fidelity mobile and desktop prototypes showcase key features utilizing a brand and UX style guide. A promotional video to inspire as well as packaging for a monthly subscription box that can be designed by users were also created as part of a branded and scalable design system. The science behind the benefits of owning and walking your dog was overwhelming. Research, surveys and SME's in the fields of veterinary health, dog foster care and design theory helped to identify pain points of users and keep a clear focus on the fitness synergy of user needs to achieive the overall design.<br>
    
    <h1> The Problem</h1>
    
    <p>
        Dogs and their owners lack a balanced lifestyle. There are over 1.9 million households with dogs in the world. Not all of these dogs and owners are living well. The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 changed the world and exposed the social isolation, anxiety, stress and poor physical health that affected many owners and in turn, their dogs. Research revealed owners are spending more hours online, less time socializing, physical aliments and substance abuse became more common and managing new routines that blend together in ambiguity became overwhelming. Dogs and owners need regular physical, mental and social activity to lead balanced, healthy lives. An unbalanced lifestyle of owners ment an unhappy dog.<br>
        What happens when our wellbeing is not balanced? <br>
        Could this be prevented? <br>
        Can the union of dog and owner be beneficial to both? <br>
    
        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
    <p>
        • Owners feel guilty when their dog is unhappy and spend over 1 billion a year on their dogs<br>
        • Dogs suffer from depression easily after 4 hours of isloation<br>
        • Multiple apps needed to do everything this app can do<br>
        • Obesity is the most common preventable disease in dogs<br>
        • Dogs and owners suffer from the same aliments of anxiety, stress & isolation<br>
        • Unhappy dogs exhibit destructive & unwanted behaviorial problems<br>
    </p>
    
    <h1> Solution</h1>
    <p>
        Combine key features into a single, useful wellness app to help owners balance their dog’s physical, mental and social health. The PawPacer mobile app helps organize, track and motivate owners to lead balanced lifestyles by walking, playing and socializing their way to good health with their dog.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Process</h1>
    <p>
        The process began by defining the key features of the app. Walk, play and socialize with the help of an interactive map, alerts and a dashboard to stay organized. Low fidelity prototypes were drawn and user journeys helped define the profiles of four types of owners. Dog personas were created and high fidelity prototypes in Figma were generated and tested. Refinements to designs were made to streamline multiple user journeys into more fluid expected patterns and build out a scalable design system. As the project moved into an expanded design system, additional elements were added. They included coding patterns in p5js, packaging designed in Illustrator and Photoshop, videos shot and assembled in After Effects, and multiple prototypes generated in Balsalmic, Marvel and finished in Figma. To align the elements, branding guidelines and a UX style guide were created. Solidifying research findings, maximizing SME feedback and additional prototype testing influenced design decisions for a final set of deliverables. Next steps would include alert screens with customized dog barks, fitness training challenges and augmented reality (AR) scavenger hunts.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Summary</h1>
    
    <p> 
        The science behind the project and research done provided insights that yielded a branded design system that is expandable, unique and utilized new skills in a variety of programs. The prototype mobile app is a viable pocket companion to inspire, motivate and track activities to attain wellness goals. Keeping the focus imprinting, natural companionship and using empathy to identify pain points, the PawPacer app encourages healthy routines to keep the delicate synergy of physical, mental and social health balanced for dogs and owners. <br>
        <H3>Be a dog walker. Walk, play and socialize yourself to a well-balanced lifestyle with your dog.</H3>
